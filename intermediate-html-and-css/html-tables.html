<!-- What is a table? -->
<!-- A structured set of data made up of rows and columns (tabular data)
allowing us to quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind of connection between different types of data 
when implemented correctly, they are handled well by accessibility tools such as screen readers - enhance the experience of sighted and visually impaired users -->

<!-- Why is it a bad idea to use HTML Tables for page layout? -->
<!-- 
    1. layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users -
    screen readers' output will confuse blind people as they interpret the tags that edist in a HTML page and read out the contents to the user
 -->

<!-- What are caption elements useful for? -->
<!-- To show a description of the table contents - useful for all readers to get a quick summary and check whether the table is useful to them -->

<!-- What is the scope attribute? -->
<!-- It can be added to the <th> element to tell the screen readers exactly what cells the header is a header for. -->

<!-- Screen readers will recongnize markup structured like this and allow their users to read out the entire column/row at once. -->
<!-- scope also has value: colgroup and rowgroup that are used for headings that sit over the top of multiple columns/rows -->
